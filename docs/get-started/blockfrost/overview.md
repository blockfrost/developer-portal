Blockfrost is a comprehensive infrastructure toolkit designed to assist developers in building projects on the Cardano platform.

At the heart of the ecosystem lies a swift, finely-tuned, and openly available API as a Service, providing an alternative gateway to the Cardano blockchain and associated networks. This service is enhanced with additional features, eliminating the necessity for individuals to manage supplementary infrastructure and tools themselves.

Besides access to the Cardano networks, it also provides access to IPFS and Milkomeda.

The core technology of Blockfrost is open source, and its development is supported by the collaborative efforts of the Cardano community.
